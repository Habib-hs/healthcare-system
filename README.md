# Healthcare Management System

This healthcare management system streamlines patient care, appointment scheduling, and medical record management. It enables efficient management of patient data, appointments, and documentation, with real-time notifications and advanced search features, all designed for scalability, security, and high performance. As a learning project, it covers a broad range of technologies, including the Java ecosystem, backend development, cloud infrastructure, and databases, while also integrating DevOps practices for deployment, continuous integration, and streamlined operations.

### Technology Stack will be use
- ****Core & Web****: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.4.1, Spring MVC, Spring Security 6.4.1, GraphQL
- ****Databases****: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- ****Search & Caching****: Elasticsearch, Redis
- ****Messaging****: Apache Kafka, RabitMQ, WebSocket, STOMP
- ****Security****: JWT, OAuth2, Spring Security
- ****API Documentation****: OpenAPI 3.0, SpringDoc
- ****Testing****: JUnit 5, Mockito, TestContainers
- ****DevOps & Cloud****: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Nginx
- ****CI/CD****: GitHub Actions, Maven, SonarQube
- ****Monitoring****: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Jaeger
- ****Others****: Liquibase, Lombok, MapStruct, ETC

### Learning Objectives
- Enterprise application development (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, GraphQL)
